 * @file 01.KeepAlive.ino
 * @brief HTTP/1.1 persistent connections (keep-alive).
 *
 * With DETWS_ENABLE_KEEPALIVE the server reuses one TCP connection for many
 * requests instead of closing after each response - the big win when a browser
 * loads a page plus its assets, or a client polls an endpoint. Behavior:
 *   - HTTP/1.1: connection stays open unless the client sends `Connection: close`
 *   - HTTP/1.0: closes unless the client sends `Connection: keep-alive`
 *   - error responses (400/413/414) always close (unknown next-request boundary)
 *   - each connection serves at most DETWS_KEEPALIVE_MAX_REQUESTS, then closes
 *   - idle connections are still reclaimed by the conn_timeout sweep
 *
 * It is fully transparent to handler code - you write the same routes; the
 * server picks keep-alive vs close and emits the right `Connection` header.
 *
 * Flash, open Serial @ 115200 for the IP, then watch one connection serve many
 * requests:
 *   curl -v http://<ip>/                 # note "Connection: keep-alive"
 *   curl -v http://<ip>/ http://<ip>/time http://<ip>/         # reuses the socket
 *
 * NOTE: optional features are gated by a compile flag the *library* sources must
 * also see. The `#define` below documents intent, but for PlatformIO enable it
 * for the whole build, e.g. in platformio.ini:
 *     build_flags = -DDETWS_ENABLE_KEEPALIVE=1
 * (Arduino IDE: it is already set for you in the build_opt.h beside this sketch, so it builds as-is.) A define in the
 * sketch alone does not reach the separately-compiled library .cpp.
