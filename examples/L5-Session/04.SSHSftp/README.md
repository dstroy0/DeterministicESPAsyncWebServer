# 04.SSHSftp - SFTP (and SCP) file server over SSH

This sketch serves files from a filesystem **over the one authenticated SSH
port**: a client's `sftp` session reads/writes/lists files, and `scp` drops a
file onto the device. It is the standards-track "southbound" path for pushing
files - e.g. NC / G-code programs - onto the device securely, alongside a shell
on the same port.

It is the SSH server example ([01.SSH](../01.SSH/)) plus **two calls**: mount a
filesystem and `det_ssh_sftp_begin(fs, root)` (+ `det_ssh_scp_begin(fs, root)`).
The SFTP subsystem and the SCP exec attach to the existing SSH channel layer.

## What you get

- **SFTP v3** (the OpenSSH `sftp` client's default): `put` / `get` / `ls` /
  `mkdir` / `rmdir` / `rm` / `rename` / `stat` / `realpath`, with streamed
  reads/writes (no heap beyond the fs layer's file handle) and a fixed handle
  table (`DETWS_SFTP_MAX_HANDLES`). Every path is checked for `..` traversal
  before touching the filesystem.
- **SCP upload** (`scp localfile admin@<ip>:/path`): the rcp SINK direction, one
  file per transfer. (Download - `scp <ip>:/path localfile` - is a follow-up; use
  `sftp get` for now.)

## What you will need

- An ESP32 board with a filesystem: this sketch mounts **LittleFS** (formats on
  first boot); an **SD card** works too - open it with `SD.begin(...)` and pass
  `SD` instead of `LittleFS`.
- An SSH **host key** provisioned in NVS (see `docs/SSH.md`, "Host key
  provisioning") - the sketch loads it with `det_ssh_rsa_load_pubkey()`.

## Configure + connect

Edit `SSID` / `PASSWORD` (and the demo password in `ssh_password_auth`), flash,
and open Serial @ **115200**. Then, from a machine with the OpenSSH client:

```bash
sftp -P 22 admin@<board-ip>        # password: s3cret
sftp> put firmware.bin /fw.bin     # upload
sftp> ls -l /                      # list
sftp> get /fw.bin copy.bin         # download (byte-exact)
sftp> mkdir /gcode
sftp> rename /fw.bin /gcode/fw.bin
sftp> rm /gcode/fw.bin

scp -P 22 part.nc admin@<board-ip>:/gcode/part.nc   # upload via scp
```

## Troubleshooting

- **`Permission denied`.** The demo accepts `admin` / `s3cret` (password auth).
  Force password auth if your client prefers keys:
  `sftp -o PreferredAuthentications=password -o PubkeyAuthentication=no ...`.
- **`No SSH host key in NVS`.** Provision the host key first (`docs/SSH.md`).
- **A big `put`/`scp` prints a broken-pipe / non-zero exit at the end but the
  file is correct.** That is the SSH server's non-graceful connection teardown
  (a plain `ssh <host> exit` shows it too, with exit 0). The transfer itself is
  byte-exact; it is a documented follow-up (a graceful `SSH_MSG_DISCONNECT`).
- **`scp <ip>:/path local` hangs / "not supported".** Download over SCP is not
  implemented yet - use `sftp get`.

## Going further

- **Bigger transfers.** SFTP `READ` returns a short `DATA` bounded by one SSH
  packet (`SSH_PKT_BUF_SIZE`); raise `SSH_PKT_BUF_SIZE` **and** `DETWS_SFTP_MAX_READ`
  for higher throughput (`SSH_CHAN_MAX_PACKET` derives from `SSH_PKT_BUF_SIZE`).
- **Restrict the mount.** Pass a subdirectory as `root` (e.g.
  `det_ssh_sftp_begin(LittleFS, "/gcode")`) so a client cannot see the whole
  volume; the `..` guard keeps requests inside it.
- **Machine-tool push.** Combine with `services/dnc` to drip a pushed `.nc`
  program to an attached controller over RS-232 / a socket.

## Build and run (PlatformIO)

The SFTP/SCP server lives inside the library, so the flags must reach the whole
build:

```bash
pio ci examples/L5-Session/04.SSHSftp \
  --board esp32dev \
  --lib "." \
  --project-option="build_flags=-DDETWS_ENABLE_SSH=1 -DDETWS_ENABLE_FILE_SERVING=1 -DDETWS_ENABLE_SSH_SFTP=1 -DDETWS_ENABLE_SSH_SCP=1"
```

(The Arduino IDE reads the flags from `build_opt.h` beside the sketch automatically.)

## How it works under the hood (for the curious)

An SSH `CHANNEL_REQUEST` of type `subsystem`/`sftp` (or `exec "scp …"`) is
recognized in the channel layer, which tags the channel and routes its data to
the SFTP/SCP binding instead of the shell echo. The binding accumulates the
channel byte stream into `SSH_FXP_*` (or rcp) records, executes each against the
`fs::FS` mount - reusing the same file operations WebDAV and the static file
server use - and frames responses back with `det_ssh_conn_send`. A large SFTP `WRITE`
(or an SCP upload) is streamed straight to the file as the fragments arrive, so a
transfer is never bounded by a buffer. The wire codecs (`services/sftp`,
`services/scp`) are pure and host-tested (`native_ssh_sftp`, `native_scp`); this
glue binds their seams to the SSH channel + `fs::FS`. HW-verified against the
OpenSSH `sftp`/`scp` clients on an ESP32-S3 with an SD card (byte-exact round
trips).
