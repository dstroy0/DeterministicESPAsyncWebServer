// HotSwapStorage - survive an SD card being pulled mid-write.
//
// A card is a connector, so it can leave while you are writing to it. The failure is quiet: the
// driver still reports a mounted volume, every write fails into nothing, and code that does not
// check carries on believing it has storage. Logs vanish, uploads truncate, and nothing says why.
//
// services/hotswap makes that loud and recoverable:
//
//   ABSENT  --probe finds a card, mount ok-->  READY
//   READY   --N consecutive I/O errors------>  FAULTED   (unmounts immediately)
//   FAULTED --probe interval, remount ok---->  READY
//
// The rule for callers is two lines: gate on dws_hotswap_ready() before touching the filesystem,
// and report the outcome of every call with dws_hotswap_io(). That is what lets a run of failures
// mean "the card left" instead of scrolling past unnoticed.
//
// Why a *run* of errors and not one: a single failed write is not proof of removal (a transient bus
// error, a full volume), and tearing down a working mount over one error is its own bug. Any
// success resets the run, so noise never accumulates into a false removal.
//
// GET /storage  -> {"storage":"ready","mounts":1,"faults":0}
// GET /write    -> appends a line, reporting the outcome to the state machine
// GET /yank     -> unmounts underneath the app, so you can watch the fault + auto-recovery without
//                  physically pulling the card (the writes that follow really do fail)
//
// Build flags (whole build): DWS_ENABLE_HOTSWAP=1
