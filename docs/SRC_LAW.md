================================================================================
SECTION 1: EMBEDDED REAL-TIME OPERATING SYSTEM & OBJECT ALLOCATION RULES
================================================================================
1. Zero Runtime Heap Allocation (Directive 4.12 / Rule A18-5-2)
   - Rule: The calling of 'malloc', 'calloc', 'realloc', 'free', 'new', or 
     'delete' is strictly forbidden once the scheduler has started execution. 
   - Exception: Allocation of memory is exclusively permitted during the system's 
     pre-initialization phase prior to calling 'vTaskStartScheduler()'.
   - Rationale: Eliminates non-deterministic timing spikes caused by dynamic heap 
     traversal and guarantees total immunity from runtime out-of-memory errors.

2. Mandatory Static Kernel Object Instantiation (FreeRTOS Specific)
   - Rule: All FreeRTOS system objects must be created via their explicit static 
     creation symbols (e.g., 'xTaskCreateStatic', 'xQueueCreateStatic', 
     'xSemaphoreCreateBinaryStatic'). Generic dynamic counterparts are banned.
   - Rationale: Forces the compiler to allocate control structures and stack regions 
     directly within the BSS/Data segments, ensuring memory layouts are unalterable 
     at runtime.

3. Static Thread Stack Sizing and Verification (Rule 18.8 / Rule A18-1-1)
   - Rule: All task stacks and local hardware buffers must be bounded using 
     compile-time constants via 'std::array' or fixed arrays. Variable-Length 
     Arrays (VLAs) are completely prohibited.
   - Rationale: Prevents unexpected runtime modifications of the CPU stack pointer, 
     enforcing a mathematically provable maximum stack depth layout before deployment.

4. Banned Task Self-Termination and Deletion Symbols
   - Rule: System tasks must execute within an infinite loop ('while(true)') and 
     are strictly forbidden from invoking 'vTaskDelete(NULL)' or self-terminating.
   - Rationale: Modifying the active task topology at runtime introduces scheduling 
     jitter and variable execution paths, violating structural time-slice consistency.

================================================================================
SECTION 2: TIME-SLICE DETERMINISM & EXECUTABLE CONTROL-FLOW RULES
================================================================================
5. Strict Function Execution Bound Timeouts (Rule A15-0-1 Alternate)
   - Rule: Any peripheral polling loop, bus read (I2C/SPI), or synchronization 
     wait must include an explicit, deterministic tick or counter timeout. Infinite 
     'while' blocks waiting on hardware status flags are banned.
   - Rationale: Ensures that if a physical hardware component fails or hangs, the 
     software thread breaks out deterministically within its assigned time slice.

6. Total Prohibition of Unstructured Control Flow (The goto Ban)
   - Rule: The 'goto' symbol, as well as unstructured 'break' or 'continue' loops 
     that alter regular conditional hierarchies, are completely banned.
   - Rationale: Guarantees that the control-flow graph remains perfectly linear 
     and scannable, making execution times predictable for worst-case execution 
     time (WCET) tools.

7. Banned Evaluative Increments (The Single Side-Effect Rule)
   - Rule: Inline increment and decrement symbols ('++', '--') are strictly banned 
     from being placed inside larger logical expressions or array subscripts 
     (e.g., write 'buffer[idx] = val; idx++;' instead of 'buffer[idx++] = val;').
   - Rationale: Eliminates variations in evaluation order across different compilers, 
     ensuring the CPU cycles spent per expression remain entirely fixed.

8. Banned Return Type Deduction and Variant Types (Rule A8-4-13)
   - Rule: The 'auto' keyword for function return types is banned. Dynamically 
     sized or variant types that change their footprint at runtime are prohibited.
   - Rationale: Enforces explicit data structures so that memory access boundaries 
     and copy overheads are identical across every single operational time slice.

================================================================================
SECTION 3: TYPE CONVERSION & EXPLICIT MEMORY SPECIFICATION RULES
================================================================================
9. Strict Type Alignment via Uniform Braced Initialization (Rule A8-5-2)
   - Rule: All fundamental variable types must be initialized using uniform 
     braced syntax (e.g., 'uint32_t scalar{100U};'). Naked variable declarations 
     without an initial explicit value are banned.
   - Rationale: Completely blocks implicit type-narrowing transformations at the 
     compiler level, ensuring data widths match the underlying CPU registers.

10. Prohibition of C-Style Cast Blocks (Rule A5-2-1)
    - Rule: Traditional C-style type brackets (e.g., '(uint32_t)variable') are 
      completely banned. Developers must exclusively use explicit 'static_cast' 
      or 'reinterpret_cast'.
    - Rationale: Restricts hidden or accidental conversions between pointers and 
      integers, ensuring all address calculations are exposed clearly to static analysis.

11. Banned Implicit Pointer-to-Boolean Evaluation
    - Rule: Evaluating a raw pointer or address symbol directly as a conditional 
      boolean flag (e.g., 'if (dev_ptr)') is banned. Comparisons must be fully 
      written out against 'nullptr' or 'NULL'.
    - Rationale: Eliminates type ambiguity during conditional branches, simplifying 
      the binary instructions generated for execution testing.

12. Explicit Unused Return Serialization (Rule A0-1-2)
    - Rule: It is prohibited to call a non-void function without handling its 
      return symbol. If a status value is intentionally skipped, it must be explicitly 
      wrapped via 'static_cast<void>(function());'.
    - Rationale: Guarantees that the omission of error checking is a conscious, 
      documented engineering decision rather than a developer oversight.

================================================================================
SECTION 4: PREPROCESSOR & STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY RULES
================================================================================
13. Banned Dynamic Macro Redefinition (#undef)
    - Rule: Using the '#undef' directive to strip away or modify an established 
      preprocessor identifier symbol is strictly forbidden.
    - Rationale: Guarantees that system feature configurations and conditional compilation 
      flags remain completely static and immutable from the first line of code to the last.

14. Banned Variadic Code Blocks (The Ellipsis Ban / Rule A8-4-1)
    - Rule: The implementation of functions or macros accepting a variable number 
      of parameters via ellipsis ('...') is completely banned.
    - Rationale: Variadic mechanics bypass compile-time type checks and introduce 
      highly non-deterministic stack allocation sequences during runtime parsing.

15. Prohibition of Comment Terminating Backslashes (Rule A2-7-1)
    - Rule: A backslash character ('\') must never be used as the final character 
      of a single-line comment block.
    - Rationale: Prevents the preprocessor from merging lines, which can accidentally 
      comment out the subsequent line of functional execution code.

OFFICIAL RECOGNITION & FOUNDATIONAL STANDARDS BIBLIOGRAPHY
================================================================================
These architectural constraints represent decades of industrial engineering 
lessons learned from field failures, aerospace anomalies, and automotive recalls. 
Learning what compliance is and what it looks like is an essential skill for any 
engineer. Building anything to a standard makes it inherently easier to describe. 
It follows rules, it's predictable, errors are more obvious and easier to trace. 
It will (in theory) reliably and faithfully do the thing you told it to, barring 
die errata, toolchain problems, linking errors, etc. The point is that you do things 
one way and one way only: whatever the maintainers enforced style is. Sometimes, it's 
safety critical, and then a committee of PhD EE and CE get together to select the 
correct style for the project and where waivers may be needed. Some rules are
inviolable no matter what and your entire product becomes non-compliant if you 
break one of those blocker level rules. These rules exist to make your control law 
deterministic. Follow them, the organizations that promulgate them exist to save lives. 
MISRA was born out of a government funded scheme in the UK to make abs controllers 
deterministic to save lives, because malfunctioning brakes are dangerous. Building 
things in or close to this style makes your code infinitely easier to debug. You can 
guarantee behavior at a certain level and then it becomes really easy to point the 
finger at that fooey func you hand rolled without rtfm for that libs api because it's 
the length of a cvs receipt, plus you've been up all night and can't remember how to 
grep (lol) pulling byte exact KAT from memory at 6am after working all night. Bad idea. 
Never french fry when you should pizza. If you french fry when you should be pizzaing 
you're gonna have a bad time.
These rules (not my be predictable and follow all the rules rant) are derived directly 
from the following governing safety-critical publications:
