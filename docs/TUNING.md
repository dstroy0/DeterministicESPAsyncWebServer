# Performance tuning

How to size the worker model for a given workload without giving up the library's
determinism guarantees (no heap after `begin()`, fixed buffers, bounded latency).
Every knob here is compile-time; the default build is the tested-deterministic
path, so you only change these when you have a specific reason.

> Prefer a UI? The [interactive build configurator](https://dstroy0.github.io/DeterministicESPAsyncWebServer/configurator.html)
> lets you tick features, tune every knob, and copy out the `build_flags` / `#define`s.
> It is generated from `src/ServerConfig.h`, so it always matches the library.

## The execution model in one paragraph

The server runs in one or more dedicated FreeRTOS worker tasks, not the user's
`loop()`. Each worker owns a disjoint partition of connection slots (slot `i` ->
worker `i % DWS_WORKER_COUNT`) plus its own event queue and scratch arena, so no
two workers ever touch the same state: there are no hot-path locks, which is what
keeps latency bounded (= deterministic) while cores run disjoint connections in
parallel. A worker blocks on its FreeRTOS task notification and is woken the moment
an event or a deferred callback is queued, so event latency is independent of the
idle-sweep cadence. `DWS_WORKER_COUNT == 1` (the default) is byte-for-byte the
original single-pipeline behavior. The lwIP callbacks that run on the tcpip thread
(shared with WiFi on Core 0) are kept minimal: a received segment is bulk-copied
into the slot's ring with a single SPSC publish, then one event is posted.

## Knobs

| Macro                      | Default              | What it does                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DWS_WORKER_COUNT`         | 1                    | Number of worker tasks. `> 1` partitions slots across cores. Must be `<= MAX_CONNS`.                                                                      |
| `DWS_WORKER_CORE`          | 1                    | Core that worker 0 pins to; worker `k` pins to `(DWS_WORKER_CORE + k) % cores`.                                                                           |
| `DWS_WORKER_TASK_PRIORITY` | 5                    | FreeRTOS priority of the worker task(s).                                                                                                                  |
| `DWS_WORKER_TASK_STACK`    | 8192                 | Per-worker task stack (bytes). A build guard requires `>= DWS_WORKER_STACK_RSA_MIN` when OIDC or SSH is enabled (RSA-2048 verify needs ~7 KB).            |
| `DWS_WORKER_STACK_RSA_MIN` | 8192                 | Enforced floor for `DWS_WORKER_TASK_STACK` once an RSA-2048 verifier (OIDC/SSH) is compiled in. Lower it only if you marshal RSA verifies off the worker. |
| `DWS_WORKER_POLL_TICKS`    | 1                    | Idle-sweep block timeout (ticks). Events wake the worker immediately regardless; this only sets how often an idle worker wakes to run the timeout sweep.  |
| `EVT_QUEUE_DEPTH`          | `MAX_CONNS * 4` (32) | Per-queue event slots; tracks `MAX_CONNS` so a raised pool never trips the `>= MAX_CONNS * 4` guard. Raise it to absorb larger connection bursts.         |
| `MAX_CONNS`                | 8                    | Connection pool size. The hard ceiling on concurrent connections.                                                                                         |

## Feature buffer & limit knobs

Every per-feature tuning knob (buffer sizes, table depths, message limits,
thresholds) lives in one place: [`src/ServerConfig.h`](../src/ServerConfig.h),
in the section **"Feature tuning knobs (grouped and gated by feature)"** at the end of
the file. You never have to open a feature header to turn one. Each is an override-able
default, so you set a new value in your `build_flags` (for example
`-D DWS_OPCUA_READ_MAX=16` or `-D DWS_GQL_MAX_DEPTH=8`) and the owning module picks
it up. A group is wrapped in its feature's `DWS_ENABLE_*` flag, so a knob only exists
when that feature is compiled in.

What is deliberately _not_ a knob and stays next to its code: protocol- and
algorithm-fixed constants (wire opcodes, magic bytes, crypto digest/block sizes,
spec-mandated PDU/field widths, and the deflate/inflate scratch sizes a `static_assert`
pins to the table layout). Changing those breaks on-the-wire conformance, so they are
not exposed as knobs.

## Board profiles (per-variant defaults)

The sizing defaults above are not one flat set. They used to be, tuned to fit the
smallest classic-ESP32 DRAM ceiling, so a board with far more RAM or flash silently
inherited the same cramped numbers. Instead, [`src/board_profiles/`](../src/board_profiles/)
layers defaults along three independent axes, selected in [`board_profile.h`](../src/board_profiles/board_profile.h)
(included first thing in `ServerConfig.h`):

- **chip** - one file per ESP-IDF die: `classic_defaults.h` (ESP32), `s2` / `s3` / `c2` /
  `c3` / `c5` / `c6` / `c61` / `h2` / `p4` `_defaults.h`, plus preview targets `s31` / `h4` /
  `h21` (in ESP-IDF `master` only). Auto-selected from `CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_*`; classic ESP32
  and host builds use the classic floor. Holds each die's chip-appropriate sizing and its
  per-die HW-crypto flags - `DWS_HW_AES` / `_SHA` / `_RSA` / `_ECC` / `_ECDSA` / `_HMAC` /
  `_DS` - which are genuinely different across the lineup (e.g. C2/C61 have no general-purpose
  AES peripheral and no RSA/MPI; C6 has no ECDSA; H4 has no RSA/DS), so gate a HW path on the
  specific flag, never on "it's an ESP32". Values track each target's ESP-IDF `soc_caps.h`.
- **PSRAM size** - `2mbpsram.h` / `4mbpsram.h` / `8mbpsram.h` / `16mbpsram.h` / `32mbpsram.h`.
  A given chip ships with or without PSRAM, so this is its own axis. Scales the RAM-backed pools up.
- **flash size** - `2mbflash.h` / `4mbflash.h` / `8mbflash.h` / `16mbflash.h` / `32mbflash.h`.
  Likewise independent; for flash-backed sizing.

Every profile default is `#ifndef`-guarded, so precedence is _first definition wins_:

```
your -D / build_opt.h override  >  PSRAM profile  >  flash profile  >  chip profile  >  classic floor
```

Nothing here overrides a value you set yourself, and the classic ESP32 gets exactly the
historical numbers, so no existing board regresses - larger variants just stop being
capped to the smallest one. Piloted so far: the edge-cache and mesh pools
(`DWS_EDGE_CACHE_SLOTS`, `DWS_EDGE_BODY_MAX`, `DWS_EDGE_FETCH_SLOTS`, `DWS_MESH_MAX_PEERS`,
`DWS_MESH_MAX_CONNS`); more sizing knobs migrate into the profiles over time.

The chip is detected automatically. PSRAM and flash size can't be read reliably from the
Arduino core, so set them for your board (they default to "none / smallest"):

```ini
; platformio.ini - an S3 with 8 MB PSRAM and 16 MB flash
build_flags = -DDWS_PSRAM_MB=8 -DDWS_FLASH_MB=16
```

ESP-IDF builds fill both in automatically from `CONFIG_SPIRAM_SIZE` /
`CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_FLASHSIZE_*`. You can still pin any individual knob with a `-D` override,
which always wins over the profile.

## Measured behavior (ESP32, esp32dev, COM3)

**Event latency is decoupled from the idle-sweep cadence.** With WiFi power-save
off to isolate scheduling, `GET /health` over 15 requests:

| `DWS_WORKER_POLL_TICKS` | avg     | min     | max     |
| ----------------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| 1                       | 27.2 ms | 12.4 ms | 35.1 ms |
| 100                     | 28.0 ms | 12.5 ms | 42.2 ms |

Identical at a 100x longer idle sweep. The pre-notification poll would have added
up to one full sweep per request (~50 ms average at `POLL_TICKS=100`).

**Idle worker wakeups scale as `tick_rate / DWS_WORKER_POLL_TICKS`.** At the
Arduino 1 kHz tick that is `1000 / POLL_TICKS` wakeups per second with no traffic
(1000/s at the default 1, 10/s at 100), each wakeup being one context switch plus
one service pass over idle slots. Raising the knob cuts that idle service-loop CPU
proportionally at no latency cost. Absolute idle CPU on a real build is dominated
by WiFi/IDF housekeeping, so the headline benefit of a high value is fewer wakeups
(CPU/power headroom), not a change to request latency.

**Parallel throughput (existing benchmark).** A CPU-bound handler (~0.2 s) under
4-way concurrency: `DWS_WORKER_COUNT=1` ~5.9 req/s vs `=2` ~9.1 req/s (~1.5x).
It is not a full 2x because worker 1 shares Core 0 with WiFi/lwIP; single-request
latency is unchanged.

## Recipes

- **Default / low latency (most builds).** Leave everything at default. One worker
  on Core 1, `loop()` freed, events serviced immediately.
- **Battery / mostly idle.** Raise `DWS_WORKER_POLL_TICKS` (e.g. 100 for a ~10 Hz
  idle sweep). Far fewer idle wakeups, and because events still wake the worker
  immediately there is no latency cost. Keep it well below your connection timeout
  so stale connections are still reaped promptly.
- **CPU-bound handlers / throughput.** Set `DWS_WORKER_COUNT=2` to run handlers
  on both cores. Expect ~1.5x, not 2x (Core 0 also runs WiFi/lwIP). Ensure
  `MAX_CONNS >= DWS_WORKER_COUNT` and that handlers touch only their own slot's
  state (the model already guarantees slot isolation).
- **Bursty connection load.** Raise `EVT_QUEUE_DEPTH` so a burst of accepts/data
  events cannot overflow a queue (an overflow is dropped, not blocked, to keep the
  tcpip thread non-blocking). Raise `MAX_CONNS` for more concurrent connections
  (BSS cost is fixed and linear).
- **Pin away from a busy core.** Set `DWS_WORKER_CORE=0` only if your app keeps
  Core 1 busy; by default Core 1 is the right home (Core 0 carries WiFi/lwIP).

## Determinism notes

- Every knob above changes fixed-size BSS or scheduling, never introduces a heap
  allocation or an unbounded loop.
- `DWS_WORKER_COUNT > 1` adds `DWS_SCRATCH_ARENA_SIZE` of BSS per extra worker
  and one event queue per worker; all static.
- The internal time base stays 1000 Hz regardless of `DWS_WORKER_POLL_TICKS`
  (see `services/clock.h`), so timeouts keep their tested 1 ms granularity.
