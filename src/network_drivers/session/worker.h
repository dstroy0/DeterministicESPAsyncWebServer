/**
 * @file worker.h
 * @brief Layer 5 (Session) - server worker identity.
 *
 * The server pipeline runs in one or more dedicated worker tasks (see
 * DETWS_WORKER_COUNT). Each worker owns a disjoint partition of connection slots
 * (slot i -> worker i % count) and its own scratch arena, so per-worker state
 * (the arena, work buffers) is selected by the caller's worker id. This header is
 * the single source of that id.
 *
 * The id is per-task/per-thread: a worker binds itself once at task entry via
 * detws_worker_set_self(); any context that has not bound an id (the user's
 * loop(), a unit test, the lwIP thread) reads 0, which is also the only valid id
 * in the default single-worker build, so DETWS_WORKER_COUNT == 1 is byte-for-byte
 * the original single-pipeline behavior.

 * a FreeRTOS task notification (no allocation, task- and tcpip-thread safe); a
 * nudge that lands between the worker's pump and its block is latched in the
 * notification count, so the next block returns at once and no event is missed.

// connection - e.g. an SSE broadcast on a timer, or ws_send from a sensor task:
// instead of calling the send API directly (which would race the worker that owns
// the slot), wrap it in a small function and hand it to the owning worker. The
// worker drains and runs deferred callbacks each service iteration.
// (DetWebServer::defer(slot, fn, arg) is the app-facing wrapper that resolves the
// slot's owner; this layer stays free of the transport/conn_pool dependency.)
//
// @p arg must remain valid until the callback runs (point it at static/global
// state, or data you keep alive). On host builds (no worker task) the callback
// runs inline immediately, so tests and loop()-driven code behave identically.
