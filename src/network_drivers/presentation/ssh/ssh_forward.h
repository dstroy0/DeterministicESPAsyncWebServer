 * @file ssh_forward.h
 * @brief SSH direct-tcpip port-forwarding owner (the `ssh -L` target side).
 *
 * The forwarding owner that the channel codec's forward seam
 * (ssh_channel_set_forward_open_cb / _data_cb) plugs into. The codec parses a
 * direct-tcpip request and routes channel data; this layer does the actual I/O -
 * it opens the outbound TCP connection through the client transport (det_client)
 * and bridges bytes both ways - so no socket code leaks into the codec. One fixed
 * table maps each forward channel to a client-transport connection; all storage is
 * static (no heap). Compiled only when DETWS_SSH_PORT_FORWARD is set.
 *
 * Security: any authenticated client can ask the server to connect anywhere (an
 * open proxy / SSRF surface), so forwarding is opt-in twice over - compiled out by
 * default, and inert until the application calls ssh_forward_begin(). Install a
 * policy callback to restrict the reachable targets.
