 * @file quic_conn.h
 * @brief Stateful QUIC v1 server connection engine (RFC 9000 / RFC 9001).
 *
 * One QuicConn drives a single QUIC connection: it parses each inbound UDP datagram into its
 * coalesced packets, removes header + AEAD protection at the right encryption level (Initial keys
 * from the client's Destination Connection ID; Handshake and 1-RTT keys from the TLS handshake it
 * runs via quic_tls), dispatches the frames, reassembles the CRYPTO stream to advance the handshake,
 * tracks packet numbers to generate ACKs, and coalesces the outbound Initial / Handshake / 1-RTT
 * packets back into datagrams. Application streams are surfaced to HTTP/3 (h3_conn) through a small
 * callback + send API, so the transport engine has no HTTP dependency.
 *
 * It is transport-free (no lwIP): quic_conn_recv() takes a received datagram and quic_conn_send()
 * pulls the next datagram to transmit, so the engine is host-testable by shuttling byte buffers
 * between a server QuicConn and a client written in the test. quic_server wires it to det_udp.
 *
 * Scope (a faithful minimal server): QUIC v1 only, no Retry / 0-RTT / key update / connection
 * migration / connection-ID rotation, in-order CRYPTO and stream reassembly, and single-range ACKs.
 * Loss recovery (PTO retransmission) is not yet implemented - the engine relies on the peer
 * retransmitting, which is correct on a reliable path; it is the next hardening step. Small packets
 * are padded to the header-protection minimum (RFC 9001 sec 5.4.2). Fixed storage, no heap.
