 * @file dtls_conn.h
 * @brief DTLS 1.3 server handshake state machine (RFC 9147 §5-6).
 *
 * The transport-neutral core that drives one DTLS 1.3 server handshake: it consumes inbound
 * datagrams and produces the outbound flight, wiring the reused TLS 1.3 message builders and key
 * schedule (tls13_msg, tls13_kdf) through the DTLS record layer (dtls_record) and handshake framing
 * (dtls_handshake). Like coap_server_process it has no sockets - the UDP glue (a later CoAPs
 * front-end) feeds it datagrams and sends whatever it emits.
 *
 * Profile: the single spec-valid suite the whole hand-rolled TLS 1.3 stack uses -
 * TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, X25519 key exchange, an Ed25519 server certificate. The handshake is the
 * one-round-trip full handshake (no PSK, no 0-RTT, no client auth):
 *
 *   epoch 0  ClientHello ->
 *            <- ServerHello                                          (epoch 0, DTLSPlaintext)
 *   epoch 2  <- EncryptedExtensions, Certificate, CertificateVerify, Finished  (DTLSCiphertext)
 *   epoch 2  Finished ->
 *   epoch 3  application data (CoAP) protected with the app-traffic keys
 *
 * Each handshake message fits one record in this profile. When the client does not offer an X25519
 * key_share up front, the server answers the first ClientHello with a HelloRetryRequest carrying a
 * stateless, address-bound cookie and renegotiates the group to X25519 (RFC 9147 §5.1); the second
 * ClientHello must echo the cookie before any asymmetric crypto is spent. Full ACK/timeout
 * retransmission (§5.8, §7) beyond the Finished acknowledgement is a follow-on increment; the framing
 * it needs already exists in dtls_handshake.
