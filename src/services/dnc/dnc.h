 * @file dnc.h
 * @brief CNC RS-232 DNC (Distributed Numerical Control) drip-feed codec (DETWS_ENABLE_DNC).
 *
 * DNC is the classic way a program is streamed to a machine-tool controller: a G-code
 * program (RS-274 / ISO 6983) is punched as blocks (one line each), framed with a
 * `%` rewind-stop at the start and end, and drip-fed over an RS-232 link with XON/XOFF
 * software flow control so the sender pauses when the controller's small input buffer
 * fills. This codec is the transport-agnostic framing + tape-code layer only - the same
 * bytes ride RS-232, a raw TCP socket, or a WebSocket; the app owns the wire.
 *
 * Two tape codes are supported (the historical split every DNC package still carries):
 *  - **ISO** (::DNC_CODE_ISO): ISO 7-bit / ASCII, End-of-Block = LF, program marker = `%`.
 *    Optional even parity in bit 7 (the ISO tape convention, RS-358).
 *  - **EIA** (::DNC_CODE_EIA): the EIA RS-244 punched-tape code - a distinct, odd-parity
 *    8-track encoding (parity in channel 5). End-of-Block = 0x80 (channel 8, used only for
 *    EOB), the rewind-stop is EIA End-of-Record 0x0B (the `%` equivalent), and there are no
 *    lowercase letters. The full character table is odd-parity-verified.
 *
 * Three pieces, all pure and zero-heap:
 *  1. character translation (::dnc_iso_to_eia / ::dnc_eia_to_iso) + ISO even-parity helper;
 *  2. XON/XOFF flow state (::DncFlow) the send pump consults before each write;
 *  3. a streaming block encoder (::dnc_encode_block + the `%`/leader framing) and a
 *     byte-at-a-time block decoder (::DncDecoder) that reassembles wire bytes back into
 *     ASCII G-code lines and reports the `%` program start/end.
