/**
 * @file forwarded_trust.h
 * @brief Trusted-reverse-proxy resolution of a forwarded client address (DWS_ENABLE_FORWARDED_TRUST).
 *
 * A `Forwarded` (RFC 7239) / `X-Forwarded-For` header is CLIENT-SPOOFABLE, so the client address it
 * carries may only be believed when the connection's real TCP peer is a reverse proxy the operator
 * trusts. This keeps a fixed BSS table of trusted-upstream CIDRs and resolves the effective client
 * address for the abuse-prevention layer: when the TCP peer matches a trusted CIDR and the forwarded
 * token is a valid, specified address, the forwarded client is used; otherwise the real TCP peer is
 * used. Fail-safe by construction - an empty table trusts no header, and a malformed / obfuscated /
 * unspecified token falls back to the TCP peer, so a direct (untrusted) client cannot spoof its way
 * out of, or another peer into, the auth lockout. Pure (no sockets, no heap), host-tested.
 *
 * The table is a single owned instance reached only through this API (mirrors the source-IP allowlist
 * and the auth-lockout table). Register upstreams with dws_forwarded_trust_add_cidr("10.0.0.0/8").
