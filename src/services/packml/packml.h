 * @file packml.h
 * @brief PackML / OMAC packaging-machine state model (ISA-TR88.00.02) - the state engine + PackTags.
 *
 * Reference standard: ISA-TR88.00.02-2022, "Machine and Unit States: An Implementation Example of ISA-88"
 * (ISBN 978-1-64331-224-8) - the OMAC PackML state model and PackTags. The 17-state model, the numeric
 * StateCurrent values, the command set, and the transition graph below follow that document.
 *
 * PackML is the OMAC / ISA-88 state model that packaging and process machines expose so a line
 * controller (usually over OPC UA) can command and observe them uniformly. Two pieces:
 *
 *  - the **state machine**: 17 states (Stopped/Idle/Execute/Held/Suspended/Complete/Aborted plus the
 *    transient "acting" states Starting/Resetting/Holding/... that auto-advance when their action
 *    finishes) driven by the control commands (Reset/Start/Stop/Hold/Unhold/Suspend/Unsuspend/Abort/
 *    Clear). Stop and Abort are the near-universal transitions to the shutdown / fault branches.
 *  - the **PackTags**: the standard Command / Status / Admin tag groups the model surfaces - the current
 *    state + unit mode, the requested/actual machine speed, and the production counters.
 *
 * This is a pure, fixed-BSS service: no heap, no I/O. The state engine (dws_packml_command /
 * dws_packml_state_complete) is a pure transition table; the owned service (dws_packml_svc_*) layers the
 * PackTags + counters + timers on top for a machine to run directly. Host-tested (native_packml).
