/**
 * @file dbm.h
 * @brief Log-structured hash key-value store on the WAL (DETWS_ENABLE_DBM, requires DETWS_ENABLE_WAL).
 *
 * A Bitcask-style key-value store: the value data lives append-only in the write-ahead log (wal_store.h)
 * and an in-RAM open-addressed hash index maps each live key to where its latest value sits in the log.
 * This is the design the measured SD envelope wants (docs/FEATURE_PERFORMANCE.md): every write is one of
 * the WAL's fast sequential appends, never a slow durable random write.
 *
 *  - **put / delete** append one record to the WAL and update the index. Writes are batched (unsynced);
 *    call ::detws_dbm_sync to checkpoint the WAL and make them durable.
 *  - **get** looks up the index and re-reads the value straight from the log (no per-key RAM copy).
 *  - **open** rebuilds the index by scanning the WAL, replaying puts and deletes in order, so the live
 *    key set is exactly what survived the last mount of the underlying store.
 *
 * The index is a fixed BSS array of ::DETWS_DBM_SLOTS slots (no heap); keys are bounded by
 * ::DETWS_DBM_KEY_MAX and values by ::DETWS_DBM_VAL_MAX. Everything fails closed at those bounds. Like the
 * other services, drive it from one context (a worker / loop), not concurrently.
 *
 * On-media record payload (inside a WAL record): `[op u8][key_len u16][val_len u32][key][value]` (LE),
 * op 0 = put, op 1 = delete (a tombstone, val_len 0).
