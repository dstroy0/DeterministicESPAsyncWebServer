 * @file sen0192.h
 * @brief DFRobot SEN0192 10.525 GHz microwave Doppler motion sensor (DWS_ENABLE_SEN0192).
 *
 * The SEN0192 is a 3-pin part (V / G / digital OUT) whose OUT line asserts while it senses motion
 * (Doppler shift) within its adjustable range. Unlike the framed serial of an LD2410, it carries no
 * protocol - it is a single digital line - so the "driver" is a debounced presence tracker over that
 * line: assert presence on an active sample and hold it for a configurable window after the last active
 * sample, so brief gaps between Doppler returns don't make presence flap.
 *
 * The presence state machine (::Sen0192Motion) is pure and host-tested - it takes a sampled line level
 * and a timestamp and needs no clock or GPIO. The ESP32 binding reads DWS_SEN0192_PIN each poll (via
 * dws_millis()) and feeds it in; only that read touches hardware. The OUT polarity and hold window come
 * from ServerConfig (DWS_SEN0192_ACTIVE_HIGH / DWS_SEN0192_HOLD_MS / DWS_SEN0192_PIN).
