 * @file roaming.h
 * @brief Wi-Fi roaming decision layer (DWS_ENABLE_ROAMING) - the policy that picks a roam target.
 *
 * The three 802.11 roaming primitives are supplicant / hardware territory: 802.11k surfaces a neighbour
 * report (candidate APs), 802.11v delivers a BSS-Transition-Management hint from the network, and 802.11r
 * does the fast transition. This module is the piece between them: the pure, deterministic policy that
 * fuses the current link's RSSI, a candidate neighbour list, and an optional BTM hint into a decision -
 * roam or stay, and to which AP and why. It holds no state and touches no radio, so it is fully
 * host-testable with synthetic inputs; the caller feeds it real data and executes the transition.
