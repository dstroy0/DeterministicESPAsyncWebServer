 * @file wearlevel.h
 * @brief Flash wear-leveling slot selector (DWS_ENABLE_WEARLEVEL).
 *
 * Flash/NVS cells wear out after a bounded number of erase cycles, so a device that repeatedly writes a
 * record (a log line, a config snapshot, a counter) to the *same* location burns that block out early.
 * This is the pure core of wear leveling: given a per-slot erase/write count, `dws_wearlevel_pick`
 * returns the least-worn slot to write next, so writes spread evenly and the whole region ages together.
 *
 * The app owns the actual slots (NVS keys, flash sectors, VFS files) and the persisted counts; this core
 * just decides *where* the next write goes and reports the wear imbalance. Pure, zero heap, no stdlib,
 * so it is fully host-testable. It composes with services/vfs (the storage medium) and services/logbuf
 * (whose sink can offload to a wear-leveled store).
