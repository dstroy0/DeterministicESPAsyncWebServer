# Render each diagram source in docs/diagrams/ to a light + dark PNG. The READMEs / docs embed these
# PNGs through a <picture> element (instead of a live fence) so the diagrams show in the GitHub web UI,
# the GitHub mobile app, AND Doxygen - the app and Doxygen do not render mermaid, and GitHub strips the
# foreignObject an inline SVG would need for the multi-line labels. A PNG bakes the labels into pixels.
#
# Two source formats:
#   *.mmd                       - Mermaid (gen_api_flow.py); one source -> light + dark via mmdc themes.
#   *.light.dot / *.dark.dot    - Graphviz (gen_flag_deps.py); a per-theme source -> the matching PNG.
#     The flag graph is a single-parent forest, which Graphviz lays out crossing-free and left-aligned -
#     Mermaid's dagre could not guarantee either. Needs the `dot` binary (apt: graphviz).
# Needs mermaid-cli (mmdc) + a Chromium, and graphviz (dot). In CI, install all; locally, run on a host
# that has them.
