# Run the native Unity test envs with gcov instrumentation and emit a merged
# SonarQube coverage report (src/ only) for the SonarCloud scan. Coverage needs
# the tests to actually RUN (not just compiledb), so this builds + runs them.
#
# One report PER ENV, unioned afterwards: gcov cannot merge the same source
# compiled with different -D flags across envs in a single pass (it throws a
# worker exception), so each env is gcovr'd on its own build dir and
# merge_coverage.py unions them into coverage.xml.
#
# A dedicated build dir (.pio_cov) + the coverage build flags keep this separate
# from the no-coverage compile-DB build. Pass an explicit env list as args to
# cover a subset (handy locally); default is every native env except codeql and
# the ThreadSanitizer env (tsan + gcov do not mix). Requires: pio + gcovr.
