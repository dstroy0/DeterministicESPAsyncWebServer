"""Union per-env SonarQube generic-coverage reports into one, with optional baseline overlay.

gcov cannot merge the same source compiled with different flags across envs in a
single pass (it raises a worker exception), so gen_coverage.sh emits one report
per env and this unions them: a line is covered if it is covered in ANY env, and
the per-line branch counts from the env that covered the most branches are kept.
Output is a single SonarQube generic-coverage report (one <file> per path).

Incremental (affected-only) CI runs pass --baseline: only the envs affected by the
diff run, so the fresh reports cover only some files. The committed coverage.xml is
overlaid so the output is still whole-project.

Which rule applies to a file depends on whether THIS run re-measured all of it. Pass
--dep-graph/--ran-envs and the decision is made per file from the compiler include
graph (test/dep_graph.json: path -> the envs that compile or include it):

  * every env that owns the file ran  -> AUTHORITATIVE: the fresh view REPLACES the
    baseline outright, and if the file produced no coverage at all this run its
    baseline record is DROPPED (it was deleted or renamed);
  * only some of its envs ran         -> UNION with the baseline (this run exercised
    only part of its callers, so replacing would wrongly lower it);
  * not recompiled at all             -> baseline kept verbatim.

Union is monotonic - it can only ever raise a line - so a file that is never made
authoritative can never lose a stale entry. That is how the committed baseline drifts:
before this, ONLY the changed .cpp paths were replaceable, so a coverage record could
outlive the code it described (headers were excluded outright, and deleted files were
immortal). --changed is still honoured as an extra force-replace set.

Usage:
    merge_coverage.py <out.xml> <report-glob>
    merge_coverage.py <out.xml> <report-glob> --baseline coverage.xml \
        --dep-graph test/dep_graph.json --ran-envs "native_a native_b"

    covered forever, even though the suite as a whole covers every branch. gcovr's JSON keeps the
    per-branch counts, so here a branch is covered if ANY env took it.

    Envs compile with different -D flags, so the same line can legitimately have a different number
    of branches in different envs. Branch indices are only comparable within one shape, so lines are
    unioned per (line, branch-count) and the widest shape seen for a line wins - that is the build
